## Introduction

zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful
scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, and tcsh were
incorporated into zsh; many original features were added. This document details
some of the unique features of zsh. It assumes basic knowledge of the standard
UNIX shells; the intent is to show a reader already familiar with one of the
other major shells what makes zsh more useful or more powerful. This document is
not at all comprehensive; read the manual entry for a description of the shell
that is complete and concise, although somewhat overwhelming and devoid of
examples.
